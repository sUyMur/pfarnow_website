**Disclaimer:** (If you have a heart condition) Please consult your doctor first. I'm no doctor and only share my experience with cold showering.

As we tumble into our daily routines we often start our days being stressed, late or lacking motivation. First thing we do is check our phones, mails, social media and didn't even get up yet. Starting your day with motivation and an inner sense of peace is possible. Boosting your metabolism while at it, is just an added benefit.

Evidence suggests that cold showers strengthens our immune system, reduce inflammation and obviously energizes you right away.[^1] :muscle:

After I saw the video by Matt D'Avella "[I took cold showers for 30 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsSBBPeNNDY)" I thought this might not be for me. The video starts with him jumping straight into the shower: full-blown, kamikaze "I'm gonna do this now" mode. Just is doing it Shia LaBeouf style[^2] and getting over with it is not my kind of *style*. It's not a positive attitude towards cold showers, the benefits you gain and also creates a mental barrier of doing it.

Allen Carr, who wrote "Stop Smoking Now"[^3], explains that we are prone to fall victim to our own attitudes. Just thinking that a cold shower might not be desirable makes us believe that. He writes about the myth:

> **The myth that quitting will be hard and miserable.**[^4]
>
> As long as you believe these two common myths, you'll find it hard to quit emotional eating. No matter how much you *want* to quit, part of your brain will be telling you you'll be happier if you don't. You need to change your mindset and that means unraveling these myths

In other words,  cold showering isn't hard and won't make you flinch. 
I read a german article[^5] about cold showers, their benefits and step by step guide on how to do it. After that I was all-in with the idea of cold showers every morning. It literally tells you right in the beginning: 

> This "Step-by-step guide will show you  how to get used to this *refreshing cooling* and how you *can't get enough* of it in the future." 

It points out how **awesome** cold showers are and that you will **miss out!** There we go! This is the attitude I needed and this is the kind of attitude I want to live by.

After having the right kind of mindset and motivation, I was about to start of my cold-shower habit. What I've done differently than Matt is, that I started of showering at a moderate temperature. Not warm, not cold, more in the way of body temperature (therefore you shouldn't feel cold). Shower as normal and try to rinse yourself with a bit colder water everyday. Your body should get used to the temperature. For me it took around 7 days to reach the coldest temperature.

This was also the point, where I understood that the coldest temperature *can* be quite nice. I coupled it with a *meditation*. This is obviously in lax terms, as I'm not standing there for 10 minutes under ice cold water. I lean into the shower and concentrate on my breathing and getting my heart rate to a (sub)resting level. This allows me to a) focus on myself for a minute, b) enjoy the freshness and c) to forget about the stress in the morning.

After a month or so, I realized, that I can also start my shower with cold water. Still not at a ice cold level, but rather fresh. I do this while showering normally and at the end, have my minute of ice-cold meditation.

Overall, I'd say this helped me tremendously to enjoy getting out of bed and wanting to jump into the shower. My day starts of great, fresh and all calm.

A quick note, this is a morning routine. Heating up your body (which happens after cold showers) is not recommendable before going to bed. As it will impact your sleep most likely in a bad way. Especially during summer, you should beware of the increase in body temperature after cold showers.
